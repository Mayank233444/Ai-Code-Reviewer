  2. **Describe the role of each variable** defined in the code, and explain how they contribute to the codeâ€™s logic.
  3. **Evaluate the code for readability** and clarity, offering suggestions for improving variable names, logic flow, and formatting if necessary.
  4. **Identify potential issues** related to performance, scalability, or maintainability, and suggest any improvements.
  
  Provide detailed explanations and, if applicable, recommend better coding practices or patterns to improve the code's overall quality.`,
      "Bug Detection": `You are given a code snippet that may contain a bug. Your task is to:
  
  1. **Carefully examine the code** to detect any issues, errors, or bugs that might cause the code to fail or produce incorrect results.
  2. **Identify the type of bug** present (e.g., syntax error, logical error, runtime exception, etc.), and explain why this is a bug.
  3. **Provide a clear explanation** of the steps to fix the bug and the rationale behind the solution.
  4. **If applicable**, suggest preventive measures or best practices to avoid similar bugs in the future.
  
  Focus on ensuring the code is correct, robust, and works as intended under all expected scenarios.`,
      "Code Correction": `You are given a code snippet that can be improved. Your task is to:
  
  1. **Review the code for potential improvements** in terms of performance, readability, and maintainability.
  2. **Detect any bugs** present in the code, and suggest fixes for them. If there are multiple bugs, identify and address each one.
  3. **Optimize the code** for better performance, such as improving efficiency, reducing complexity, or enhancing clarity.
  4. **Add detailed docstrings** to all functions, methods, and classes, explaining their purpose, parameters, return values, and any important logic.
  5. **Refactor the code** to follow best practices and improve its structure, making it easier to understand, maintain, and extend.
  
  Provide a better version of the code that incorporates these improvements, ensuring it is well-documented, clean, and free of errors.`,
